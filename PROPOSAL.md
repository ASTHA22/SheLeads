# SheLeads - Empowering the Next Generation of Women Leaders
## Hackathon Proposal

---

## 🎯 Pitch Line
"SheLeads" isn't just a platform — it's a movement. We bridge gaps in opportunity, amplify voices, and prepare women to lead the future.

---

## 📋 Problem Statement
Despite progress, women remain underrepresented in leadership roles across industries. A lack of mentorship, limited access to networks, and skill gaps contribute to this disparity.

## 💡 Our Solution
A digital platform that combines **mentorship**, **networking**, and **skill-building** to support women aiming for leadership positions.
